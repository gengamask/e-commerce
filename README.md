# e-commerce

## Description

Have I ever wondered how all the other e-commerce company, like Amazon, manage and sort out their products? and the answer is, YES I HAVE. With this reason, I have created the sample of the back-end database for the e-coomerce, seperating items by its categories. All the CRUD fucntions are ready to use and the categories, products, and tags can be created, modified, viewed, and be deleted as user's will.
